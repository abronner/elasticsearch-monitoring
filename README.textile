h2. Cluster monitoring with elasticsearch and kibana

This repository presents an elegant way to monitor your elasticsearch cluster. 

The idea is simple and straightforward:
* get all nodes statistics with nodes stats API and index them back in elasticsearch 
* repeat it periodically (e.g. every 5 minutes)
* use ttl to automatically limit nodes stats history (e.g. 60 days)
* visualize nodes statistics with kibana
